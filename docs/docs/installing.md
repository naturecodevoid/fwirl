# Installing

[[toc]]

## 1. Download the plugin

First you'll want to download the plugin. [Download it here](/download/). If that doesn't work, go to the
[latest GitHub release](https://github.com/naturecodevoiddev/fwirl/releases/latest) and download the `.jar` file.

## 2. Install it onto your server

Simply move the `fwirl-x.x.x.jar` to your `plugins` folder. Fwirl is compatible with
[Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/), [Paper](https://papermc.io/) and [Purpur](https://purpurmc.org/). Since it uses the
Spigot API, it should also be compatible with other spigot forks. Fwirl was originally written with the 1.18.2 Paper API
but to allow for more compatibility, we have switched to the 1.15.2 Spigot API. This means that the plugin should be
compatible with versions 1.15+, but it is only tested on 1.18. If you are having issues with the plugin, just
[create a GitHub issue](/docs/support.md).

## 3. Configure it

Make sure to take a look at the [configuration](/docs/config.md) and [permissions](docs/permissions.md) documentation.
There are also [guides for each feature](/docs/features/).
